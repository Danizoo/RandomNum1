The way that becomes a way 
is not the Immortal Way
the name that becomes a name
is not the Immortal Name 
the maiden of Heaven and Earth has no name
the mother of all things has a name 
thus in innocence we see the beginning
in passion we see the end 
two different names
for one and the same 
the one we call dark
the dark beyond dark 
the door to all beginnings
===
All the world knows beauty 
but if that becomes beautiful 
this becomes ugly 
all the world knows good 
but if that becomes good 
this becomes bad 
the coexistence of have and have not 
the coproduction of hard and easy 
the correlation of long and short 
the codependence of high and low 
the correspondence of note and noise 
the coordination of first and last 
is endless 
thus the sage performs effortless deeds 
and teaches wordless lessons 
he doesn't start all the things he begins 
he doesn't presume on what he does 
he doesn't claim what he achieves 
and because he makes no claim 
he suffers no loss
===
Bestowing no honors 
keeps people from fighting 
prizing no treasures 
keeps people from stealing 
displaying no attractions 
keeps people from making trouble 
thus the rule of the sage 
empties the mind 
but fills the stomach 
weakens the will 
but strengthens the bones 
by keeping the people from knowing or wanting 
and those who know from daring to act 
he thus governs them all
===
The Tao is so empty
those who use it 
never become full again
and so deep 
as if it were the ancestor of us all
dulling our edges
untying our tangles
softening our light 
merging our dust
and so clear 
as if it were present 
I wonder whose child it is 
it seems it was here before Ti
===
Heaven and Earth are heartless 
treating creatures like straw dogs 
heartless is the sage 
treating people like straw dogs 
between Heaven and Earth 
how like a bellows 
empty but inexhaustible 
each movement produces more 
talking only wastes it 
better to keep it inside
===
The valley spirit that doesn't die 
we call the dark womb 
the dark womb's mouth 
we call the source of creation 
as real as gossamer silk 
and yet we can't exhaust it
===
Heaven is eternal and Earth is immortal 
the reason they're eternal and immortal
is because they don't live for themselves 
hence they can live forever
thus the sage pulls himself back 
but ends up in front
he lets himself go
but ends up safe 
selflessness must be the reason 
whatever he seeks he finds 
===
The best are like water 
bringing help to all 
without competing 
choosing what others avoid 
hence approaching the Tao 
dwelling with earth 
thinking with depth 
helping with kindness 
speaking with truth 
governing with peace 
working with skill 
moving with time 
and because they don't compete 
they aren't maligned
===
Instead of pouring in more
better stop while you can
making it sharper
won't help it last longer 
houses full of treasure
can never be safe 
the vanity of success 
invites its own failure
retire when your work is done 
this is the Way of Heaven 
===
Can you hold fast your crescent soul and not let it wander 
can you make your breath as soft as a baby's 
can you wipe your Dark Mirror free of dust 
can you serve and govern without effort 
can you be the female at Heaven's Gate 
can you light up the world without knowledge 
beget things and keep them 
but beget without possessing 
keep without controlling 
this is Dark Virtue
===
Thirty spokes converge on a hub 
but it's the emptiness 
that makes a wheel work 
pots are fashioned from clay 
but it's the hollow 
that makes a pot work 
windows and doors are carved for a house 
but it's the spaces 
that make a house work 
existence makes something useful 
but nonexistence makes it work
===
The five colors make our eyes blind 
the five tones make our ears deaf 
the five flavors make our mouths numb 
riding and hunting make our minds wild 
hard-to-get goods make us break laws 
thus the rule of the sage 
puts the stomach ahead of the eyes 
thus he picks this over that
===
Favor and disgrace are like warnings 
honor and disaster are like the body 
and why are favor and disgrace like warnings 
favor means descending 
to gain it is like a warning 
to lose it is like a warning 
thus are favor and disgrace like warnings 
and why are honor and disaster like the body 
the reason we have disaster 
is because we have a body 
if we didn't have a body 
we wouldn't have disaster 
who honors his body as much as the world 
can be entrusted with the world 
who loves his body as much as the world 
can be encharged with the world
===
We look but don't see it 
and call it indistinct 
we listen but don't hear it 
and call it faint 
we reach but don't grasp it 
and call it ethereal 
three failed means to knowledge 
I weave into one 
with no light above 
with no shade below 
too fine to be named 
returning to nothing 
this is the formless form 
the immaterial image 
this is the waxing waning 
we meet without seeing its face 
we follow without seeing its back 
holding onto this very Way 
we rule this very realm 
and discover its ancient past 
this is the thread of the Way
===
The ancient masters of the Way 
aimed at the indiscernible 
and penetrated the dark 
you would never know them 
and because you wouldn't know them 
I describe them with reluctance 
they were careful as if crossing a river in winter 
cautious as if worried about neighbors 
reserved like guests 
ephemeral like melting ice 
simple like uncarved wood 
open like valleys 
and murky like puddles 
but a puddle becomes clear when it's still 
and stillness becomes alive when it's roused 
those who treasure this Way 
don't try to be full 
not trying to be full 
they can hide and stay hidden
===
Let limits be empty 
the center be still 
ten thousand things rise 
we watch them return 
creatures without number 
all return to their roots 
return to their roots to be still 
to be still to revive 
to revive to endure 
knowing how to endure is wisdom 
not knowing is to suffer in vain 
knowing how to endure is to be all-embracing 
all-embracing means impartial 
impartial means the king 
the king means Heaven 
Heaven means the Way 
and the Way means long life 
life without trouble
===
During the High Ages people knew they were there 
then people loved and praised them 
then they feared them 
finally they despised them 
when honesty fails 
dishonesty prevails 
hesitate and guard your words 
when their work succeeds 
let people think they did it
===
When the Great Way disappears 
we meet kindness and justice 
when reason appears 
we meet great deceit 
when the six relations fail
we meet obedience and love
when the country is in chaos 
we meet honest officials 
===
Get rid of wisdom and reason 
and people will live a hundred times better 
get rid of kindness and justice 
and people once more will love and obey 
get rid of cleverness and profit 
and thieves will cease to exist 
but these three sayings are not enough 
hence let this be added 
wear the undyed and hold the uncarved 
reduce self-interest and limit desires 
get rid of learning and problems will vanish
===
Yes and no 
aren't so far apart
lovely and ugly 
aren't so unalike 
what others fear
we too must fear 
before the moon wanes
everyone is gay 
as if they were at the Great Sacrifice
or climbing a tower in spring 
I sit here and make no sign
like a child that doesn't smile 
lost with no one to turn to 
while others enjoy more
I alone seem forgotten 
my mind is so foolish  
so simple 
others look bright
alone seem dim 
others are certain 
I alone am confused 
receding like the ocean
waxing without cease
everyone has a goal 
I alone am dumb and backward
for I alone choose to differ 
preferring still my mother's breast 
===
The expression of empty virtue 
comes from the Tao alone 
the Tao as a thing 
waxes and wanes 
it waxes and wanes 
but inside is an image 
it wanes and waxes 
but inside is a creature 
it's distant and dark 
but inside is an essence 
an essence fundamentally real 
and inside is a heart 
throughout the ages 
its name has never changed 
so we might follow our fathers 
how do we know what our fathers were like 
through this
===
Partial means whole 
crooked means straight 
hollow means full 
worn-out means new 
less means content 
more means confused 
thus the sage holds onto the one 
to use in guiding the world 
not watching himself he appears 
not displaying himself he flourishes 
not flattering himself he succeeds 
not parading himself he leads 
because he doesn't compete 
no one can compete against him 
the ancients who said partial means whole 
came close indeed 
becoming whole depends on this
===
Whispered words are natural 
a gale doesn't last all morning 
a squall doesn't last all day 
who else could make these 
only Heaven and Earth 
if Heaven and Earth can't make things last 
what about Man 
thus in whatever we do 
let those on the Way be one with the Way 
let those who succeed be one with success 
let those who fail be one with failure 
be one with success 
for the Way succeeds too 
be one with failure 
for the Way fails too
===
Who tiptoes doesn't stand 
who strides doesn't walk 
who watches himself doesn't appear 
who displays himself doesn't flourish 
who flatters himself achieves nothing 
who parades himself doesn't lead 
on the road they say
too much food and a tiring pace
some things are simply bad 
thus the Taoist shuns them
===
Imagine a nebulous thing 
here before Heaven and Earth 
silent and elusive
it stands alone not wavering 
it travels everywhere unharmed 
it could be the mother of us all
not knowing its name
I call it the Tao 
forced to name it 
I name it Great 
great means ever-flowing 
ever-flowing means far-reaching
far-reaching means returning 
the Tao is great
Heaven is great 
Earth is great
the king is also great 
the realm contains four greats 
of these the king is one 
Man imitates Earth 
Earth imitates Heaven
Heaven imitates the Tao 
the Tao imitates itself
===
Heavy is the root of light 
still is the master of busy 
thus a lord might travel all day 
but never far from his supplies 
even in a guarded camp 
his manner is calm and aloof 
why would the lord of ten thousand chariots 
treat himself lighter than his kingdom 
too light he loses his base 
too busy he loses command
===
Good walking leaves no tracks 
good talking reveals no flaws 
good counting counts no beads 
good closing locks no locks 
and yet it can't be opened 
good tying ties no knots 
and yet it can't be undone 
thus the sage is good at saving 
and yet abandons no one 
nor anything of use 
this is called cloaking the light 
thus the good instruct the bad 
the bad learn from the good 
not honoring their teachers 
not cherishing their students 
the wise alone are perfectly blind 
this is called peering into the distance
===
Recognize the male 
but hold onto the female 
and be the world's maid 
being the world's maid 
don't lose your ancient virtue 
not losing your ancient virtue 
be a newborn child again 
recognize the pure 
but hold onto the defiled 
and be the world's valley 
being the world's valley 
be filled with ancient virtue 
being filled with ancient virtue 
be uncarved wood again 
recognize the white 
but hold onto the black 
and be the world's guide 
being the world's guide 
don't stray from ancient virtue 
not straying from ancient virtue 
be without limits again 
uncarved wood can be split to make tools 
the sage makes it his chief official 
a master tailor doesn't cut
===
Trying to govern the world with force 
I see this not succeeding
the world is a spiritual thing 
it can't be forced
to force it is to harm it 
to control it is to lose it 
sometimes things lead 
sometimes they follow 
sometimes blow hot
sometimes blow cold 
sometimes expand
sometimes collapse 
therefore the sage avoids extremes 
avoids extravagance 
avoids excess
===
Use the Tao to help your king 
don't use weapons to rule the land 
such things soon return 
where armies camp 
brambles grow 
best to win then stop 
don't make use of force 
win but don't be proud 
win but don't be vain 
win but don't be cruel 
win when you have no choice 
this is to win without force 
virility means old age 
this isn't the Tao 
what isn't the Tao ends early
===
Weapons are not auspicious tools 
some things are simply bad 
thus the Taoist shuns them 
in peace the ruler honors the left 
in war he honors the right 
weapons are not auspicious 
weapons are not a ruler's tools 
he wields them when he has no choice 
dispassion is the best 
thus he does not beautilY them 
he who beautifies them 
enjoys killing others 
he who enjoys killing others 
achieves no worldly rule 
thus we honor the left for joy 
we honor the right for sorrow 
the left is where the adjutant stands 
the commander on the right 
which means as at a funeral 
when you kill another 
honor him with your tears 
when the battle is won 
treat it as a wake
===
The Tao has never had a name 
simple and though small 
no one can command it 
if a lord upheld it 
the world would be his guest 
when Heaven joins with Earth 
they bestow sweet dew 
no one gives the order 
it comes down to all 
the first distinction gives us names 
after we have names 
we should know restraint 
who knows restraint knows no trouble 
to picture the Tao in the world 
imagine rivers and the sea
===
Who knows others is perceptive 
who knows himself is wise 
who conquers others is forceful 
who conquers himself is strong 
who knows contentment is wealthy 
who strives hard succeeds 
who doesn't lose his place endures 
who dies but doesn't perish lives on
===
The Tao drifts 
it can go left or right 
everything lives by its grace 
but it doesn't speak 
when its work succeeds 
it makes no claim 
it has no desires 
shall we call it small 
everything turns to it 
but it wields no control 
shall we call it great 
therefore the sage never acts great 
thus he can do great things
===
Hold up the Great Image 
and the world will come 
and be beyond harm 
safe serene and at one 
fine food and song 
detain passing guests 
when the Tao speaks 
it's senseless and plain 
we look and don't see it 
we listen and don't hear it 
but we use it without end
===
What you would shorten 
you should therefore lengthen 
what you would weaken 
you should therefore strengthen 
what you would topple 
you should therefore raise 
what you would take 
you should therefore give 
this is called hiding the light 
the weak conquering the strong 
fish can't survive out of the deep 
a state's greatest tool 
is not meant to be shown
===
The Tao never does a thing 
yet there is nothing it doesn't do
if a ruler could uphold it 
people by themselves would change 
and changing if their desires stirred
he could make them still 
with simplicity that has no name
stilled by nameless simplicity
they would not desire 
and not desiring be at peace
the world would fix itself
===
Higher Virtue is not virtuous 
thus it possesses virtue 
Lower Virtue is not without virtue 
thus it possesses no virtue 
Higher Virtue lacks effort 
and the thought of effort 
Higher Kindness involves effort 
but not the thought of effort 
Higher Justice involves effort 
and the thought of effort 
Higher Ritual involves effort 
but no response 
until it threatens and compels 
when the Way is lost virtue appears 
when virtue is lost kindness appears 
when kindness is lost justice appears 
when justice is lost ritual appears 
ritual marks the waning of belief 
and onset of confusion 
augury is the flower of the Way 
and beginning of delusion 
thus the great choose thick over thin 
the fruit over the flower 
therefore they pick this over that
===
Of things that became one in the past 
Heaven became one and was clear 
Earth became one and was still 
spirits became one arid were active 
sfreams became one and were full 
kings became one and ruled the world 
but by implication 
Heaven would crack if it were always clear 
Earth would crumble if it were always still 
spirits would fail if they were always active 
streams would dry up if they were always full 
kings would fall if they were always high and noble 
thus the noble is based on the humble 
the high is founded on the low 
thus do kings refer to themselves 
as orphaned widowed and destitute 
but is this the basis of humility 
counting a carriage as no carriage at all 
not wanting to clink like jade 
they clunk like rocks
===
The Tao moves the other way 
the Tao works through weakness 
the things of this world come from something 
something comes from nothing
===
When a great person hears of the Way 
he follows it with devotion 
when an average person hears of the Way 
he doesn't know if it's real or not 
when a small person hears of the Way 
he laughs out loud 
if he didn't laugh 
it wouldn't be the Way 
hence these sayings arose 
the brightest path seems dark 
the qUickest path seems slow 
the smoothest path seems rough 
the highest virtue low 
the whitest white pitch-black 
the greatest virtue wanting 
the staunchest virtue timid 
the truest truth uncertain 
the perfect square lacks corners 
the perfect tool does nothing 
the perfect sound is hushed 
the perfect form is shapeless 
the Tao is hidden and has no name 
but because it's the Tao 
it knows how to start and how to finish
===
The Tao gives birth to one 
one gives birth to two 
two gives birth to three 
three gives birth to ten thousand things 
ten thousand things with yin at their backs 
and yang in their embrace 
and breath between for harmony 
what the world hates 
to be orphaned widowed or destitute 
kings use for their titles 
thus some gain by losing 
others lose by gaining 
thus what people teach 
I teach too 
tyrants never choose their deaths 
this becomes my teacher
===
The weakest thing in the world 
excels the strongest thing in the world 
what doesn't exist finds room where there is none 
thus we know doing nothing succeeds 
teaching without words 
succeeding without effort 
few in the world can equal this
===
Which is more vital 
fame or health 
which is more precious 
health or riches 
which is more harmful 
loss or gain 
the deeper the love 
the higher the cost 
the bigger the treasure 
the greater the loss 
who knows contentment 
suffers no shame 
who knows restraint 
encounters no trouble 
and thus lives long
===
The greatest thing seems incomplete 
yet it never wears out 
the fullest thing seems empty 
yet it never runs dry 
the straightest thing seems crooked 
the cleverest thing seems clumsy 
the richest thing seems poor 
activity overcomes cold 
stillness overcomes heat 
who can be perfectly still 
is able to govern the world
===
When the Tao prevails 
courier horses manure fields instead of roads 
when the Tao fails 
war-horses are raised on the border 
no crime is worse than yielding to desire 
no wrong is greater than discontent 
no curse is crueler than getting what you want 
the contentment of being content 
is true contentment indeed
===
Without going out his door 
he knows the whole world 
without looking out his window 
he knows the Way of Heaven 
the farther people go 
the less people know 
therefore the sage knows without moving 
names without seeing 
succeeds without trying
===
Those who seek learning gain every day 
those who seek the Way lose every day 
they lose and they lose 
until they find nothing to do 
nothing to do means nothing not done 
who rules the world isn't busy 
if someone is busy 
he can't rule the world
===
The sage has no mind of his own 
his mind is the mind of the people 
to the good he is good 
to the bad he is good 
until they become good 
to the true he is true 
to the false he is true 
until they become true 
in the world the sage withdraws 
with others he merges his mind 
people open their ears and eyes 
the sage covers them up
===
Appearing means life 
disappearing means death 
thirteen are the followers of life 
thirteen are the followers of death 
but people living to live 
join the land of death's thirteen 
and why 
because they live to live 
it's said that those who guard life well 
aren't injured by soldiers in battle 
or harmed by rhinos or tigers in the wild 
for rhinos have nowhere to sink their horns 
tigers have nowhere to sink their claws 
and soldiers have nowhere to sink their blades 
and why 
because for them there is no land of death
===
The Way begets them 
Virtue keeps them 
matter shapes them 
usage completes them 
thus do all things honor the Way 
and glorifY Virtue 
the honor of the Way 
the glory of Virtue 
are not conferred 
but always so 
the Way begets and keeps them 
cultivates and trains them 
steadies and adjusts them 
nurtures and protects them 
but begets without possessing 
acts without presuming 
and cultivates without controlling 
this is called Dark Virtue
===
The world has a maiden 
she becomes the world's mother 
who knows the mother 
understands the child 
who understands the child 
keeps the mother safe 
and lives without trouble 
who blocks the opening 
who closes the gate 
lives without toil 
who unblocks the opening 
who meddles in affairs 
lives without hope 
who sees the small has vision 
who protects the weak has strength 
who uses his light 
who trusts his vision 
lives beyond death 
this is the Hidden Immortal
===
Were I sufficiently wise 
I would follow the Great Way
and only fear going astray 
the Great Way is smooth 
but people love byways
their palaces are spotless 
their fields are overgrown
and their granaries are empty 
they wear fine clothes
they carry sharp swords
they tire of food and drink
and possess more than they need 
this is called robbery 
and robbery is not the Way
===
What is planted right is not uprooted 
what is held right is not ripped away 
future generations worship it forever 
cultivated in the self virtue becomes real 
cultivated in the family virtue multiplies 
cultivated in the village virtue increases 
cultivated in the state virtue prospers 
cultivated in the world virtue abounds 
thus view the self through the self 
view the family through the family 
view the village through the village 
view the state through the state 
view the world through the world 
how do we know what the world is like 
through this
===
He who contains virtue in abundance 
resembles a newborn child 
wasps don't sting him 
beasts don't claw him 
birds of prey don't carry him off 
his bones are weak his tendons are soft 
and yet his grip is firm 
he hasn't known the union of sexes 
and yet his penis is stiff 
so full of essence is he 
he cries all day 
yet never gets hoarse 
so full of breath is he 
who knows how to breathe endures 
who knows how to endure is wise 
who lengthens his life tempts luck 
who breathes with his will is strong 
but virility means old age 
this isn't the Way 
what isn't the Way ends early
===
Those who know don't talk 
those who talk don't know 
seal the opening 
close the gate 
dull the edge 
untie the tangle 
soften the light 
join the dust 
this is called the Dark Union 
it can't be embraced 
it can't be abandoned 
it can't be helped 
it can't be harmed 
it can't be exalted 
it can't be debased 
thus does the world exalt it
===
Use direction to govern a country 
use indirection to fight a war 
use inaction to rule the world 
how do we know this works 
the greater the prohibitions 
the poorer the people 
the sharper the weapons 
the darker the realm 
the smarter the scheme 
the stranger the outcome 
the finer the treasure 
the thicker the thieves 
thus the sage declares 
I change nothing 
and the people transform themselves 
I stay still 
and the people adjust themselves 
I do nothing 
and the people enrich themselves 
I want nothing 
and the people simplifY themselves
===
Where government stands aloof 
the people open up 
where government steps in 
the people slip away 
happiness rests in misery 
misery hides in happiness 
who knows where they end 
there is no direction 
direction turns into indirection 
good turns into evil 
the people have been lost 
for a long long time 
thus the sage is an edge that doesn't cut 
a point that doesn't pierce 
a line that doesn't extend 
a light that doesn't blind
===
In governing people and caring for Heaven 
nothing surpasses economy 
economy means planning ahead 
planning ahead means accumulating virtue 
accumulating virtue means overcoming all 
overcoming all means knowing no limit 
knowing no limit means guarding the realm 
guarding the realm's mother means living long 
this means deep roots and a solid trunk 
the Way of long and lasting life
===
Ruling a great state 
is like cooking a small fish 
when you govern the world with the Tao 
spirits display no powers 
not that they display no powers 
their powers do people no harm 
not that their powers do people no harm 
the sage does people no harm 
and neither harms the other 
for both rely on Virtue
===
The great state is a watershed 
the confluence of the world 
the female of the world 
through stillness the female conquers the male 
in order to be still 
she needs to be lower 
the great state that is lower 
governs the small state 
the small state that is lower 
is governed by the great state 
some lower themselves to govern 
some lower themselves to be governed 
the great state's only desire 
is to unite and lead others 
the small state's only desire 
is to join and serve others 
for both to achieve their desire 
the greater needs to be lower
===
The Tao is creation's sanctuary 
treasured by the good 
it keeps the bad alive 
beautiful words might be the price 
noble deeds might be the gift 
how can we abandon 
people who are bad 
thus when emperors are enthroned 
or ministers installed 
though there be great discs of jade 
followed by teams of horses 
they don't rival one who sits 
and offers up this Way 
why the ancients exalted it 
did they not proclaim 
who searches thereby finds 
who errs thereby escapes 
thus the world exalts it
===
Act without acting 
work without working 
taste without tasting 
great or small many or few 
repay each wrong with virtue 
plan for the hard while it's easy 
work on the great while it's small 
the hardest task in the world begins easy 
the greatest goal in the world begins small 
therefore the sage never acts great 
he thus achieves great things 
who quickly agrees is seldom trusted 
who makes it all easy finds it all hard 
therefore the sage makes everything hard 
he thus finds nothing hard
===
It's easy to rule while it's peaceful 
it's easy to plan before it arrives
it's easy to break while it's fragile 
it's easy to disperse while it's small
act before it exists 
govern before it rebels 
a giant tree grows from the tiniest shoot
a great tower rises from a basket of dirt 
a thousand-mile journey begins at your feet
but to act is to fail 
to control is to lose
therefore the sage doesn't act 
he thus doesn't fail
he doesn't control
he thus doesn't lose 
when people pursue a task
they always fail near the end 
care at the end as well as the start
means an end to failure
the sage thus seeks what no one seeks
he doesn't prize hard-to-get goods 
he studies what no one studies 
he turns to what others pass by 
to help all things be natural 
he thus dares not act
===
The ancient masters of the Way 
tried not to enlighten
but to keep men in the dark
what makes the people hard to rule 
is knowledge 
who rules the realm with knowledge
spreads evil in the realm
who rules without knowledge 
spreads virtue in the realm 
who understands these two
understands the universal key
understanding the universal key 
this is called Dark Virtue 
Dark Virtue goes deep 
goes far
goes the other way 
until it reaches perfect harmony 
===
The reason the sea can govern a hundred rivers 
is because it has mastered being lower 
thus it can govern a hundred rivers 
thus if the sage would be above the people 
he should speak as if he were below them 
if he would be before them 
he should act as if he were behind them 
thus when the sage is above 
the people are not burdened 
when he is in front 
the people are not hindered 
the world never wearies 
of pushing him forward 
because he doesn't struggle 
no one can struggle against him
===
The world calls me great
great but useless
because I am great I am useless
if I were of use
I would have stayed small
but I possess three treasures
I treasure and uphold
first is compassion
second is austerity
third is reluctance to excel
because I am compassionate
I can be valiant
because I am austere
I can be extravagant
because I am reluctant to excel
I can be chief of all tools
if I renounced compassion for valor
austerity for extravagance
reluctance for supremacy
I would die
compassion wins every battle
and outlasts every attack
what Heaven creates
let compassion protect
===
In ancient times 
the perfect officer wasn't armed 
the perfect warrior wasn't angry 
the perfect victor wasn't hostile 
the perfect commander acted humble 
this is the virtue of nonaggression 
this is using the strength of others 
this is uniting with Heaven 
which was the ancient end
===
In warfare there is a saying 
rather than a host 
better to be a guest 
rather than advance an inch 
better to retreat a foot 
this means to form no column 
to wear no armor 
to brandish no weapon 
to repulse no enemy 
no fate is worse than to have no enemy 
without an enemy we would lose our treasure 
thus when opponents are evenly matched 
the remorseful one prevails
===
My words are easy to understand 
easy to employ 
but no one can understand them 
no one can employ them 
words have an ancestor
deeds have a master 
because they have no understanding 
people fail to understand me 
rare are they who understand me 
thus am I exalted 
the sage therefore wears coarse cloth 
and keeps his jade inside
===
To understand yet not understand 
is transcendence 
not to understand yet understand 
is affliction 
the reason the sage is not afflicted 
is because he treats affliction as affliction 
hence he is not afflicted
===
When people no longer fear authority 
a greater authority will appear 
don't restrict where people dwell 
don't repress how people live 
if they aren't repressed 
they won't protest 
thus the sage knows himself 
but doesn't reveal himself 
he loves himself 
but doesn't exalt himself 
thus he picks this over that
===
Daring to act means death
daring not to act means life
of these two
one benefits
one harms
what Heaven hates
who knows the reason
the Way of Heaven
wins easily without a fight
answers wisely without a word
comes quickly without a summons 
plans ingeniously without a thought
the Net of Heaven is all-embracing 
its mesh is wide but nothing escapes
===
If people no longer fear death 
why do we threaten to kill them 
and if others fear death 
and still act perverse 
and we catch and kill them 
who else will dare 
as long as people fear death 
the executioner will exist 
to kill in the executioner's place 
is to take the carpenter's place 
who takes the carpenter's place 
is bound to hurt his hands
===
The reason the people are hungry 
is because those above levy so many taxes 
thus the people are hungry 
the reason the people are hard to rule 
is because those above are so forceful 
thus the people are hard to rule 
the reason the people think little of death 
is because those above think so much of life 
thus the people think little of death 
meanwhile those who do nothing to live 
are more esteemed than those who love life
===
When people are born 
they are soft and supple 
when they perish 
they are hard and stiff 
when plants shoot forth 
they are soft and tender 
when they die 
they are withered and dry 
thus it is said 
the hard and strong are followers of death 
the soft and weak are followers of life 
when an army becomes strong it suffers defeat 
when a plant becomes hard it snaps 
the hard and strong dwell below 
the soft and weak dwell above
===
The Way of Heaven 
is like stringing a bow 
pulling down the high 
lifting up the low 
shortening the long 
lengthening the short 
the Way of Heaven 
takes from the long 
and supplements the short 
unlike the Way of Man 
taking from the short 
and giving to the long 
who can find the long 
and give it to the world 
only those who find the Way 
thus the sage does not presume on what he does 
or claim what he achieves 
thus he chooses to hide his skill
===
Nothing in the world is weaker than water 
but against the hard and the strong 
nothing excels it 
for nothing can change it 
the soft overcomes the hard 
the weak overcomes the strong 
this is something everyone knows 
but no one is able to practice 
thus the sage declares 
who accepts a country's disgrace 
we call the lord of soil and grain 
who accepts a country's misfortune 
we call the king of all under Heaven 
upright words sound upside down
===
In resolving a great dispute 
a dispute is sure to remain 
how can this be good
thus the sage holds the left marker 
he makes no claim on others 
thus the virtuous oversee markers 
the virtueless oversee taxes 
the Way of Heaven favors no one
but always helps the good
===
Imagine a small state with a small population 
let there be labor-saving tools 
that aren't used 
let people consider death 
and not move far 
let there be boats and carts 
but no reason to ride them 
let there be armor and weapons 
but no reason to employ them 
let people return to the use of knots 
and be satisfied with their food 
and pleased with their clothing 
and content with their homes 
and happy with their customs 
let there be a state so near 
people hear its dogs and chickens 
and live out their lives 
without making a visit
===
True words aren't beautiful 
beautiful words aren't true 
the good aren't eloquent 
the eloquent aren't good 
the wise aren't learned 
the learned aren't wise 
the sage accumulates nothing 
but the more he does for others 
the greater his existence 
the more he gives to others 
the greater his abundance 
the Way of Heaven 
is to help without harming 
the Way of the sage 
is to act without struggling
