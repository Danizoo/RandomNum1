This meditation starts with a singing bowl strike, and ends with a bell.
Between those, it is empty.
It is intentionally so - no background, nosounds effects.
Reality, the essense of stillness, the current of life - are always present. You always have enough, wether it be singing birds, the sound of traffic, people talking, or your own breath. It is always new, always alive.
This empty meditation tries to respect that.
Much love.
