This meditation starts with a singing bowl strike, and ends with a bell.
Between those, it is empty.
It is intentionally so - no background music or any sounds effects.
The essence of reality is always present, you always have enough, you are always surrounded with life, wether it's birds outside, the sound of traffic, people talking, or your own breath. It is always new, always alive.
