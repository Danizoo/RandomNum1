My name is Daniel, and I developed this app!

I'm super happy and excited that you're here, using something that I created, wherever you are around the world.
Really, it's amazing to me.

I care a lot about this app and about your experience. I invested many months thinking, designing, testing, coding and developing it, and I always think about ways to improve it!

I chose to keep all the main content completely free and without ads - because I believe that's the right and respectful way to go for this app.
I’ve recently added some optional extra content that you can unlock by watching an ad, but everything that was originally here stays free forever!

If you're enjoying this app and getting value from it, it would be super cool if you'd consider supporting me by donating any amount you feel like.
