My name is Daniel, and I developed this app!

I'm super happy and excited that you're here, using something that I created, wherever you are around the world.
Really, it's amazing to me.

I care a lot about this app and about your experience. I invested many months thinking, designing, testing, coding and developing it, and I always think about ways to improve it!
I decided to keep it free, and without ads.

If you're enjoying this app and getting some value from it,
it would be super cool if you'd consider supporting me by donating whatever amount of money you feel like.
Anything is ok ðŸ˜Š
