The next best is one who is loved and praised by the people.
Next comes one who is feared.
Worst is one who is despised.

The best leader puts great value in words and says little
So that when his work is finished
The people all say, “We did it ourselves!”

Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.”
