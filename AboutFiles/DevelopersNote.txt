Hello, dear Taoists ♥

I'm deeply moved by your reviews and emails!
They're awesome to receive, and isnpired me to think about building more things that people would find beneficial and meaningful.

If you have any ideas for things you’d like to use, have, and see built, please feel free to share them with me, and maybe before long we'll see them up and running! We can also discuss and explore the ideas together, and maybe even collaborate. NDAs or any other agreements are totally acceptible if needed.

Feel free to contact at:
