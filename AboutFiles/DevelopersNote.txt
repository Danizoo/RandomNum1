Hello, dear Taoists â™¥
I hope you're doing wonderfully,
and remembering that everything is a part of the Tao.
I wanted to let you now I've built a little quotes extension for Google Chrome.
Each time you open a new tab, you get a cool looking tab with all necessary functionalities and a beautiful inspiring and deep quote (Not just Tao quotes, but many others).
I think it could set nice reminders of wisdom throughout the day.

It's called "Isnpirational Quotes New Tab", by wisdomLabs.
You can search for it in the Chrome Web Store,
or type this in your Chrome broweser on your computer, you can go to:
https://tinyurl.com/wisdomLabsQuotes
download and install it.

Yours,
Daniel G.
