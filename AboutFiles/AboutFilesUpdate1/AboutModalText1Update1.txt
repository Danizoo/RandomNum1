This app is made as an attribution and with love for the "Tao Te Ching" by the chinese philosopher Lao Tzu.
While Taoism and Confucianism are not the same, I took the liberty to put in some few quotes by Confucius, which seemed beautiful and inspiring to me.
If you want to suggest a quote, please plaese please
