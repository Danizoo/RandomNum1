The English translations brought in this app are the ones I chose after examining many, and that I thought would well represent a wide variety of interpretations while still being relevant, understandable, and well-written. The 1868 translation of John Chalmes is the first English translation of the Tao Te Ching. The transliteration is a Latin, Wade-Giles representation of the way the words are pronounced in Chinese.

For support, or any other inquiries:
