The English translations brought in this app are the ones I chose after examining many, and that I felt would well represent a fun variety of interpretations, while still being relevant, understandable, and inspiring. The 1868 translation of John Chalmers is the first English translation of the Tao Te Ching. The transliteration uses Wade-Giles romanization of Chinese.
